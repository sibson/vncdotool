vncdotool
------------

vncdotool is a command line VNC client.
It can be useful to automating interactions with virtual machines or
hardware devices that are otherwise difficult to control.

It's under active development and seems to be working, but please report any problems you have.

Quick Start
--------------------------------
To use vncdotool you will need a VNC server, most virtualization products
include one, you can use RealVNC, TightVNC or clone you Desktop using x11vnc.

Once you have a server running you can install vncdotool from pypi::

    pip install vncdotool

and then send a message to the vncserver with::

    vncdo -s vncserveraddress type "hello world"

You can also take a screen capture with::

    vncdo -s vncservername capture screen.png


More documentation can be found at ReadtheDocs_.
